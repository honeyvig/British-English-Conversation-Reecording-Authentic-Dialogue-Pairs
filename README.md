Certainly! Below is a Python script that simulates managing the conversational data collection task. It keeps track of two participants, their conversation topics, and simulates a conversation recording process.

import time
import random
import os

# Define a class for managing participants and their tasks
class ConversationTask:
    def __init__(self, participant1_name, participant2_name, task_id):
        self.task_id = task_id
        self.participant1_name = participant1_name
        self.participant2_name = participant2_name
        self.completed = False
        self.recording_time = 0
        self.total_time = 2.5 * 60  # Total time in minutes (2.5 hours)
        self.topics = ["Finance", "Education", "Health", "Entertainment", "Technology"]
        self.current_topic = 0

    def start_conversation(self):
        """Simulate the conversation start."""
        print(f"Starting conversation between {self.participant1_name} and {self.participant2_name}.")
        print(f"Task ID: {self.task_id}")
        print(f"Topic: {self.topics[self.current_topic]}")
        print("Starting 30-minute conversation...")
        
    def record_conversation(self):
        """Simulate recording the conversation."""
        while self.recording_time < self.total_time:
            # Simulating conversation by incrementing time
            time.sleep(1)  # Simulate time passing (can be adjusted for real-time or testing purposes)
            self.recording_time += 0.1  # Incrementing by 0.1 minutes (6 seconds)
            
            # Print progress every few minutes
            if self.recording_time % 30 == 0:
                print(f"Recorded {self.recording_time} minutes of conversation.")
            
            if self.recording_time >= 30:
                self.move_to_next_topic()
        
        self.complete_task()

    def move_to_next_topic(self):
        """Move to the next topic once the current one is completed."""
        self.current_topic += 1
        if self.current_topic < len(self.topics):
            print(f"Moving to next topic: {self.topics[self.current_topic]}")
        else:
            print("All topics completed!")
    
    def complete_task(self):
        """Simulate the completion of the task."""
        self.completed = True
        print(f"Conversation between {self.participant1_name} and {self.participant2_name} is complete.")
        print(f"Task ID: {self.task_id} completed!")
        print("Please upload your recording after each session.")
    
    def upload_recording(self):
        """Simulate uploading the recording."""
        print("Uploading recording...")
        # Simulate random upload success or failure
        upload_success = random.choice([True, False])
        if upload_success:
            print("Recording uploaded successfully!")
        else:
            print("Failed to upload the recording. Please try again.")

# Function to create a task for participants
def create_task(participant1_name, participant2_name):
    task_id = random.randint(1000, 9999)
    task = ConversationTask(participant1_name, participant2_name, task_id)
    task.start_conversation()
    task.record_conversation()
    task.upload_recording()

# Main function to initiate and manage tasks
def main():
    # Collect participant names
    print("Please enter the names of the participants.")
    participant1_name = input("Enter name of Participant 1: ")
    participant2_name = input("Enter name of Participant 2: ")

    # Create a task for the pair of participants
    create_task(participant1_name, participant2_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation:

    ConversationTask Class:
        Attributes: It keeps track of two participants, task ID, current topic, total recording time, and progress.
        Methods:
            start_conversation(): Begins the conversation and prints the first topic.
            record_conversation(): Simulates the conversation, records the time, and progresses through topics.
            move_to_next_topic(): Moves to the next topic when the current topic's time (30 minutes) is completed.
            complete_task(): Marks the task as completed after all topics are discussed.
            upload_recording(): Simulates uploading the recording with random success or failure.

    create_task() Function:
        This function generates a random task_id for the pair, starts the conversation, records it, and attempts to upload the recording.

    main() Function:
        Collects participant names and creates a conversation task for them.

How the script works:

    The script simulates a conversation between two participants by sequentially assigning topics and tracking the time spent on each.
    The script continues until all topics are covered (2.5 hours of total time), and then it uploads the recording (with random success/failure).

Example Output:

Please enter the names of the participants.
Enter name of Participant 1: John
Enter name of Participant 2: Sarah
Starting conversation between John and Sarah.
Task ID: 1234
Topic: Finance
Starting 30-minute conversation...
Recorded 30 minutes of conversation.
Moving to next topic: Education
Recorded 60 minutes of conversation.
Moving to next topic: Health
...
Conversation between John and Sarah is complete.
Task ID: 1234 completed!
Please upload your recording after each session.
Uploading recording...
Recording uploaded successfully!

Notes:

    This script is a simulation, meaning it doesn't actually handle audio recordings or uploads. It's designed to show the structure and how tasks could be tracked.
    You can modify the time.sleep() or random upload part to make the simulation more realistic for testing.
